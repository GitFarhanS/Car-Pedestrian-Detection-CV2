# Car-Pedestrian-Detection-CV2

In this project, I am working with OpenCV (cv2) library in Python to perform object detection in a video stream. I start by importing the necessary libraries and loading pre-trained classifiers for car and pedestrian detection. I then capture frames from a video file using VideoCapture, and convert each frame to grayscale. Next, I use the carTracker and pedestrianTracker to detect cars and pedestrians in the grayscale frame, respectively, using the detectMultiScale method. I draw rectangles around the detected objects using the coordinates obtained from the detection results. Finally, I display the processed frame with the drawn rectangles using imshow, and wait for a key press with waitKey. This code runs in a loop until the video ends, providing real-time object detection in the video stream.
